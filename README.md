# chat-example

This is the source code for a very simple chat example used for 
the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide 
of the Socket.IO website.

Please refer to it to learn how to run this application.

## Homework

Here are some ideas to improve the application:

* Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects
* Add support for nicknames
* Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.
* Add “{user} is typing” functionality
* Show who’s online
* Add private messaging
* Share your improvements!
